        <h2>BRIEF</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>My 'Exploring Indentity' module in university involved developing a personal brand. We were required to consider all aspects of a personal brand, including tone of voice, typography, visual identities and a set of brand guidelines in order to establish an image that would represent you. Finally we had to tie everything together and consider how our personal brand would be displayed as an personal portfolio website.</p>

<h2>APPROACH</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Before jumping into the deep end there were alot of things to consider. I needed to ensure my personal brand conveyed exactly who I am and what I do. The visual identity aspects I considered were a monogram, wordmark and visual marque. The main dominant asset for my brand was the visual marque. I decided to take an illustrative approach to communicate my personal style and interests. The marque acts as a storyteller into the brands identidy, linking to my personality and my work. The marque is a flat design style, a style which is kept consistent throughout the brand. For my monogram and wordmark I opted for for a clean, professional, quite bold, angular approach.</p>
    
    
    <p>After I had designed all branding material my next step was to create a set of <a class="guidelines" href="http://martinemcgrath.github.io/brand-guidelines/brand-guidelines.html">brand guidelines.</a> I put together a webpage including a set of rules explaining how my brand works. These guidelines communicated the brands personality and vision. </p>

    <h2>FINISHED OUTCOME</h2> 
        <hr>
    
    <p>I decided to create a single page website based around the brands visual marque. The website is broke up into sections including the homepage, portfolio, about and contact.  </p>
